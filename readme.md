# Telegram Bot Tempalte
>A fairly basic boilerplate code to scaffold Telegram bot projects using TypeScript and esbuild. 

## How to use
1. **Create a repository** based on this template and clone it.
2. **Install the dependencies**, including the dev ones by running `npm i -D`. 
3. Create an `.env`-file and add the two variables:
    - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with the token of the bot you created;
    - `PORT` that the server will be running on.
4. Launch the bot by running either `npm dev` or `npm run build && npm start`
